# hello-world
This is the first time I'm making a repository and trying out this website. I'm open for any feedback and excited to start :>

I just graduated BS MA from Ateneo de Manila University. My interests in mathematics specifically involve graph theory and statistics. At the time of the initial phase of making this repository, I am currently taking some online courses regarding R since I need a better review than the time when I was first learning statistics under a professor who is known across countless studies for being sadistic and difficult to pass under. Wish me luck haha.
